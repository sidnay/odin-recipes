    <h1> Tasty Pork </h1>

    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Pork sauce, belly, and leg are the best cuts for roasting. Choose fresh-looking meat, preferably with a thick layer of fat. Though many people shy away from joints with fat, it adds flavor and helps keep the joint moist while cooking (dried out meat is one of the major faults when cooking pork). You don't have to eat the fat unless you want to, but you will benefit from leaving it on in the oven. Free range and organic pork will always have a thick layer of delicious pork fat. </p>
    <p>It's always difficult to know how much pork you need to ensure everyone gets enough to eat. For four to six people, plan on about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) of meat (including fat). Add 1 pound for every two to four additional guests. Don't worry about having too much leftover because pork is delicious in cold sandwiches.</p>
